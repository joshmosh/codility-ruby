# 🔮 Codility Ruby

My solutions to the lessons found on https://app.codility.com/programmers/. Each lesson is broke out into separate folders with Ruby files for each solution. I changed the naming for some of the parameters for readability. Each solution has it's own set of tests that are included and automatically run when executing the ruby file.

## ⚓️ Requirements

+ Ruby v2.2.10 - This is because the examples on Codility are using Ruby v2.2.
+ Minitest v5.11 (or use Bundler)

## 👟 Running Examples

Assuming you're in the Lesson 01 - Iterations folder. If you were to run `ruby binary_gap.rb`. The expected output should be:

```
MiniTest::Unit::TestCase is now Minitest::Test. From binary_gap.rb:15:in `<main>'
Run options: --seed 38944
